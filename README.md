# Image-Analysis
During my path to study about Image Analysis I found lot of problem in remembering each and every concept, after few days I have to revise them all for this I think if I can make a pictorial representation of entire concepts and relate it with something that I am familiar with then it will be not forgetable to me so easily as we remember whatever unusual we see or whatever interest us the most.So here is my try to make a image analysis library for pictures.Where I will post a concept I learn about Image analysis each day in form of my art. Today I am relating it to Avengers.
